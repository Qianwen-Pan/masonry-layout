Masonry Layout Project

Description
This project is a masonry grid layout similar to Pinterest. It's built using React and the react-masonry-css library. The grid items are fetched from a Node.js/Express backend and displayed in a responsive masonry layout. The project also includes features like client-side filtering of grid items.
